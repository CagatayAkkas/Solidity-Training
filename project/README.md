# Project Documentation: ChainPrices

## Project Overview

The control system for preventing product tax evasion and stockpiling.

###Benefits

- Keep all the stolen money (millions of dolars) in the system.
- Keep all the money which spent as transaction fee for each transaction(0.5 billion transactions in year) done with credit cards.
- Force markets to give bills to the custormers.
