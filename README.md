# Project Documentation: ChainPrices

## Project Overview

The control system for preventing product tax evasion and stockpiling.

## Benefits

- Keep all the stolen money (millions of dolars) in the system.
- Keep all the money which spent as transaction fee for each transaction(0.5 billion transactions in year) done with credit cards.
- Force markets to give bills to the custormers.
- Buying a product without taking the bill means stealing from the government which is haram. Prevent billions of haram transaction.
- Stopping overpriced products and usin a transparent, trustless and provable system will affect nations sociology and psychology possitively.

## Objectives

- It allows users to make their purchases more transparently and securely.
- Allow users to see any transction (buying, punishing, product request)on the releated chain.
- Tax evasion etc. avoids situations.
- Helps sellers manage their stock.

## Scope

1. User Registration and Authentication.
2. Ability of vendors to request products from suppliers.
3. Penalty to sellers for incorrect transactions.
4. View past transaction.
5. Control product stock
6. Pull data from on-chain to off-chain with using API

## Requirements

### Software Requirements

- Python
- HTML
- Javascript
- Web3.js
- Flask
- Metamask
- Solidity
- EVM
- Foundry
- Haqq Testnet
- UI Framework (e.g., Bootstrap)

### Application Architecture

- Frontend: HTML, Javascript, Bootstrap
- Backend: Solidity, Python

## Implementation

- Frontend: The user interface will be developed with HTML, Javascript and Bootstrap along with Buy, Sell, Add Money, Money and Transaction components.
- Backend: The server will perform operations such as validating, performing, saving operations using Solidity and Python.

## Testing

Testing will include unit tests and integration tests for both front-end and back-end components. Test cases will cover user registration, product exchange, penalty control and transaction accuracy.

## Conclusion

The project offers a solution to the difficulty of control in tax transactions in today's world, the difficulty of tracking inventories, and the non-prosecution of fines.
